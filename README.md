# NCKU Microprocessor Labs

This repository includes implementations for the microprocessor labs at National Cheng Kung University. Each lab explores different PIC microcontroller programming concepts, enhancing hands-on skills with assembly and C integration.

## Labs Overview

### Lab 1: Setup and Instruction Set
- **Focus**: Basics of MPLAB X IDE, assembly operations, and instruction set.
- **Tasks**: Basic arithmetic, conditional comparisons, bit manipulations.

### Lab 2: Addressing Modes
- **Focus**: Using direct and indirect addressing modes.
- **Tasks**: Sum memory values with indirect addressing, sort data, perform binary search.

### Lab 3: Bitwise Operations and Multiplication
- **Focus**: Bitwise manipulation and arithmetic/logical shifts.
- **Tasks**: Perform shifts, 16-bit multiplication, calculate ceiling of base-2 logarithm.

### Lab 4: Macros and Subroutines
- **Focus**: Creating reusable macros and subroutines.
- **Tasks**: Subtraction/multiplication macros, cross-product subroutine, Fibonacci calculation.

### Lab 5: C and Assembly Integration
- **Focus**: Combine C with assembly for mathematical functions.
- **Tasks**: Implement ceil(sqrt(a)), GCD, and signed multiplication functions.

### Lab 6: LED Control and Button Debouncing
- **Focus**: LED control, button debouncing, and handling input signals.
- **Tasks**: Control LED states, resolve button bounce issues, create responsive patterns.
